# Document Information

DocumentComment: <text> About This SPDX Manifest: This SPDX document was 
generated with ScanCode and provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES
OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. ScanCode is a free 
software code scanning tool from nexB Inc. and others. 
Visit https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/ for support and download. 
TI is using the SPDX tool because SPDX generates a high-quality, 
industry-standardized manifest for TI customers.  TI believes these 
standardized manifests will enable TI customers to more easily integrate
multiple manifests from their suppliers into the comprehensive manifest 
they are supplying to their customers. Please recognize that while TI has 
done some initial review of the information for accuracy, no manifest is 
perfect and  it is possible that something may be missed.  It is also 
important to note that the SHA1 values for the files may not be the final 
checksums, even though we have reviewed the copyright and license information.

About SPDX: SPDX is an industry working group that is working on an ongoing 
basis to develop and improve a standard method for the exchange of licensing 
information (see http://spdx.org).  TI is participating in this working 
group in order to (i) provide the industry with an overall improvement 
in the quality and consistency of manifests, and (ii) give suppliers and 
customers a firm foundation on which to build and constantly improve their 
manifests.  Please note that SPDX is an evolving standard and, therefore, 
SPDX manifests you receive from TI and other suppliers in the future may 
not be exactly the same, but will show improvements in quality and ease of use.

CreatorComment: <text>
This SPDX document is primarily an electronic scan (with some editing) of the 
source used by Texas Instruments to build this package.

While every attempt has been made to ensure its accuracy, machine 
translations are not always perfect.

In addition, it is possible that some files have been modified prior
