PLECS_xtra includes the required codegen and coder target files for the TI2837x target.
I was unable to find these online so they were acquired from Dylan and are preserved here.
The TI2837xS target files are NOT a suitable substitute and will not result in a PWM through the booster chip.
Uniflash may not be included with these files as it is over 100MB. 
However this may be downloaded from the internet (https://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH#downloads) with atleast version 6.4.0 being confirmed to work.
-These folders need to be set in PLECS preferences
