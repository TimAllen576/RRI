PLECS_xtra includes the required codegen and coder target files for the TI2837x target.
I was unable to find these online so they were acquired from Dylan and are preserved here.
The TI2837xS target files are NOT a suitable substitute and will not result in a PWM through the booster chip.
Uniflash may not be included with these files as it is over 100MB. 
However this may be downloaded from the internet with atleast version 6.4.0 being confirmed to work.
